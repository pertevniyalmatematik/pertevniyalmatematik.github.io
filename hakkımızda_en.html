    <h2 class="grup-baslik">Who are we?</h2>
    <p class="grup-paragraf">
    We are the students of Pertevniyal who do not see mathematics merely as a subject or an academic pursuit, but as the purest form of understanding, thinking, and questioning the universe. This club is the starting point of a journey that goes beyond numbers.

Our goal is not just to learn formulas or solve problems; it is to improve our way of thinking, deepen our analytical perspective, and grow our mathematical awareness together.

Behind every question lies a new realm of thought; behind every proof, a new discovery awaits. In this club, we come together to experience the excitement of exploring mathematics together‚Äîto discuss, think, and create.

Because we know that mathematics is not a result, but a way of thinking. And our greatest passion is to build, live, and share this mindset together.
    </p>

    <h2 class="grup-baslik">What do we aim for?</h2>
    <p class="grup-paragraf">
      Our aim is to redefine mathematics not merely as a school subject, but as a fundamental way of thinking, questioning, and understanding.

In this direction, we strive to create and share by publishing our own mathematics magazine; to draw inspiration by exploring the lives of distinguished Turkish and international mathematicians; and to transform mathematics into a living discipline through organized talks and discussions.

At the same time, by participating in academic research competitions, we aim to become active contributors to science and to provide a guiding resource for students who wish to pursue further studies in this field.

     üèõÔ∏è Pertevniyal High School: A Legacy of Education Since 1872
Founded in 1872 by Pertevniyal Valide Sultan, Pertevniyal High School stands as one of the most significant educational institutions of the 19th-century Ottoman modernization era. Located in Aksaray, Istanbul, this historic school has embraced contemporary education since its inception and remains one of the rare institutions that bridge the educational legacy from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey.

Today, operating as an Anatolian High School, Pertevniyal continues to prepare its students for higher education through a rigorous academic program, a disciplined learning environment, and a dedicated and experienced teaching staff.

Beyond academic excellence, the school distinguishes itself through a vibrant ecosystem of student clubs, scientific projects, cultural activities, and social responsibility initiatives. This multidimensional approach fosters not only intellectual growth but also nurtures critical thinking, ethical values, and a strong sense of civic duty.

By preserving its rich historical heritage while embracing modern educational principles, Pertevniyal High School continues to evolve‚Äîplaying a key role in shaping Turkey‚Äôs next generation of responsible, skilled, and forward-thinking individuals.
